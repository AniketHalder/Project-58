            <p>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.Naruto is generally a very simple minded, easy going, cheerful person. He often rushes things, and misses obvious things such as Hinata's constant shyness around him. In the beginning of the series, Naruto is very fun loving, often pulling pranks on fellow villagers. This usually ends in a scolding from Iruka Umino.</p>
